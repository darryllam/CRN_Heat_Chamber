run python script by using files 

-=- General Training Script for lstm on Kalman Data
-=- Must move data you want to train on into ../real_data_kalman/train
-=- Must move data you want to test on  into ../real_data_kalman/test
-=- saves weight as weights_train_lstm_simple.h5
source train_lstm_simple

-=- loads weight trained above by source test_lstm_simple to be viewed again 
source test_lstm_simple

-=- General Training script for variable size data shown in report as simulated data
source train_jupiter_data

-=- Just see results from variable size data weights
source test_jupiter_data

-=- Script for using weights which were trained on kalman_max40.csv & kalman_max60run2.csv  
source test_lstm_simple_1

-=- Script for using weights which were trained on kalman_max40.csv & kalman_max60run1.csv  
source test_lstm_simple_2

-=- Script for using weights which were trained on kalman_max60run1.csv & kalman_max60run2.csv  
source test_lstm_simple_40

-=- Script to do future prediction was trained on all sample and predicts into unknown future
source lstm_simple_future_predict

-=- Does live predictions
source lstm_simple_live_predict


-------------------------------=-Windowed Method Is Below-=-----------------------------------------------

-=- General Training Script for lstm on Kalman Data window method
-=- Must move data you want to train on into ../real_data_kalman/train
-=- Must move data you want to test on  into ../real_data_kalman/test
-=- saves weight as weights_lstm_w_train.h5
source lstm_w_train

-=- loads weight trained above by lstm_w_train to be viewed again window method
source test_lstm_simple

-=- Script for using weights which were trained on kalman_max40.csv & kalman_max60run2.csv  window method
source lstm_w_test1

-=- Script for using weights which were trained on kalman_max40.csv & kalman_max60run1.csv  window method
source lstm_w_test2

-=- Does live predictions window method
source lstm_w_live_predict

-=- Script to do future prediction was trained on all sample and predicts into unknown future but using windows
source lstm_w_future_predict
