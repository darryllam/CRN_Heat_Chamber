Due to closure of non-essential laboratories at UBC in response to COVID-19 as of March 17, 2020, there were a number of topics we were unable cover or implement. In particular, we were unable to gather more reliable data using our redesigned  Raspberry Pi based data acquisition unit. With more data, we would be able to more thoroughly validate our machine learning models, simulations, as well as investigate the effectiveness of data assimilation. In addition, while the code to predict internal temperature in real-time exists, as we were unable to gain access to the laboratory, we were unable to implement or test this feature into the heat chamber.
